## 3 - Hexagonal

### Vocabulary

We can continue building the application and now see how to controlle the bulb.
If we think our application following the hexagonal architecture, the light interface is a driven port and the Shelly MQTT implementation of it is an adapter.
We now need a driving port to controlle the light that we call `Server`:

```go
type Server interface {
	LightOn(ctx context.Context, name string) error
	LightOff(ctx context.Context, name string) error
	LightChangeColor(ctx context.Context, name string, color *domain.Color) error
	LightChangeWhite(ctx context.Context, name string, white *domain.White) error
}
```

We can imagine multiple adapters of the `Server` port: a http server, a CLI, a website.

To make the link between the driving and the driven ports, we have the controller service:

```go
type Controller struct {
	lights     map[string]driven.Light
}

func (c *Controller) Handle(ctx context.Context, event *domain.Event) error {}
```

The controller knows the lights available and can handle events.
A event is part of the domain definition of the application:

```go
type Event struct {
	Target string
	Device Device
	Action Action
	Args   *Args
}

type Device string

const (
	Light  = "light"
)

type Action string

const (
	On          = "on"
	Off         = "off"
	ChangeColor = "change_color"
	ChangeWhite = "change_white"
)

type Args struct {
	OnArgs          *OnArgs
	OffArgs         *OffArgs
	ChangeColorArgs *ChangeColorArgs
	ChangeWhiteArgs *ChangeWhiteArgs
}

type OnArgs struct{}

type OffArgs struct{}

type ChangeColorArgs struct {
	Color *Color
}

type ChangeWhiteArgs struct {
	White *White
}
```

You can have a look to all the new files in `internal`.
The services are already implemented.

### Server adapters

Now the vocabulary of the application is defined, we can work on implementing adapters of the server port to actually controlle the bulb.

We will do two adapters, a HTTP server and a CLI

#### HTTP server

In go, there are plenty of HTTP server, one of the most used is [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

A structure of an implementation of a Gin server is made in the `internal/adapter/driving/server/http.go` file.
There is a structure `HttpServer` which contains a `Server` and which can `Run()` to start the HTTP server.

The objective here is to get the data from the HTTP call and to call the server with this data.

ðŸ«µ You can implement the Gin handler function of the file. The function should bind the data and call the server. Here is a useful [link](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/bind-query-or-post/) to the Gin documentation.

When the `HttpServer` is implemented, you can look to the `cmd/http/main.go` file which does the dependency injections and start the HTTP server, and run:

```bash
go run cmd/http/main.go
```

to start the HTTP server.

You can change the bulb color with a curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"name": "mock", "color": {"blue": 200, "gain": 100}}' http://localhost:8080/light/color
```

The color of the bulb on [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/) or using `make bulb-color` should be blue.

#### CLI

For building a CLI able to controlle the bulb, we can use the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) package.
Similar to what we did for the HTTP server, we create a structure `CliServer` which contains a `Server` and which can `Run()` to execute the CLI.

The code is verbose for writing a CLI, therefore it is already written.
You can look at it in `internal/adapter/driving/server/cli.go`.

ðŸ«µ You can copy the `cmd/http/main.go` file into `cmd/cli/main.go` file and adapt it to not run the `HttpServer` but the `CliServer`.

Run:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go light color -n mock -r 100 -b 200 -g 100
```

This changes the color of the bulb to purple using the CLI.
